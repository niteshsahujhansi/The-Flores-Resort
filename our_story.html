    <h2>A Short History Of The Flores Resort</h2>
    <div class="power">
        <p>The Flores Resort was established by my Grandfather the Honorable J.H.Abbott, OBE and is still known as
            Bungalows
            37 and 38 in the Cantonments Records. From the very start my grandfathers’ idea proved to be fruitful, as
            Yanam
            was a fast growing Cantonment and there was a demand for accommodation and good food from the local
            population,
            resident British Officers and Officers visiting the station. </p>

        <p>As the station grew, demand increased and my
            grandfather added more cottages adjacent to the existing main building. By 1910 the renovation work was
            completed. The Resort as it stands today covers the area of the old Resort. The Resort prospered then, not
            only
            from occupancy, but also from frequent social gatherings and functions when Turkey and other exotic meats
            available at the time were served.</p>

        <p>A table at the Restaurant, which was situated where the present Reception
            area and Restaurant are located, had to be booked months in advance, particularly during the festive seasons
            of
            Diwali, Xmas and New Year. Further prosperity came to the Resort when in the 1930’s Yanam was selected over
            Kakinada Port, as a stopover for the air route between the UK and Australia. Flights were available on
            British
            Airways, Air France and KLM. One of the deciding factors was that Yanam had an established reputable Resort
            that
            could accommodate the airline staff and their passengers. The Flores Resort provided transport from the
            airfield
            to the Resort and after a memorable overnight stopover the passengers were taken to the airfield for their
            onward morning flight to Calcutta or Karachi. This arrangement continued until the outbreak of the Second
            World
            War in 1936 when passenger flights were stopped but the hotel continued to prosper with the transfer of
            troops
            for the Burma and Malaysia campaigns.</p>


        <p> My Grandfather died in 1946 and the Resort was taken over by my father
            colonel R.L.Abbott. After his death in 1963 I assumed control and still take an active interest in the
            management of the current establishment. In the early days the Resort had provided modern facilities to a
            high
            standard but as time progressed these needed revisiting. I am pleased that the recent total refurbishment of
            the
            hotel has once again brought the Flores Resort up to international class standards and once again it is the
            leading hotel in puducherry.</p>

    <h2>The power of passion</h2>
    <div class="power">
        <div class="div1">
            <p>Our English mansion house has been a hotel since 1922, but was originally three distinct private houses,
                built in the late Victorian period for aristocratic families. I have been proud to be the GM of this
                property for the past 16 years and I am especially proud of the many awards we have won for our service,
                driven by a team of incredibly passionate individuals who have been recognised by our industry for their
                contribution. Most of my senior team have been with us for more than 10 years and several for more than
                15 years, giving us a real sense of community.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div1">
            <p>Our location, directly facing Kensington Palace, is perfect for local exploration, from the winding
                Kensington Church Street with its myriad of boutiques on the north side, to the charming red brick
                terraces to the south.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div1">
            <p>I am also proud of our long-standing partnerships, including the iconic Royal Albert Hall and Kensington
                Palace, alongside our support for the British Exploring Society, for whom we have raised funds to give
                underprivileged young people the opportunity to discover their own potential. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div1">
            <p>We have recently taken exploration to a different level with our new immersive ‘Urban Foraging’
                experience. Other signature experiences include our Smoking Old Fashioned, prepared by our Chief
                Mixologist Angelo in Stables Bar, or a private recital in your suite by the Royal Philharmonic
                Orchestra. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div1">
            <p>We look forward to welcoming you to our very special English Mansion Hotel."</p>
