            <p>My dream of working for an international hotel group started more than a decade ago when I joined Red
                Carnation Hotels as a Management Programme Participant. Over the years I have grown with this brilliant
                company. I now join The Flores Resort with a continued focus of offering exceptional value and service
                to our guests. Each individual team member is dedicated to making your experience with us memorable. I
                look forward to personally welcoming our guests to their home away from home.</p>

                product we provide our valued guests is second to none and that, having once experienced The Flores
                Resort, our guests will not want to stay anywhere else. If you have not been one of our guests before it
                would be my pleasure to welcome you to our fine Resort. A few members of my team below would also like

                Flores Resort. I moved to the Food & Beverage department in 2018, where I continue to take pride in the
                way in which we go above and beyond guests' expectations time and again. It is my pleasure to take care

                organise any additional extras you may like such as chocolates, champagne and strawberries, which would

            <h4>narangatharv@gmail.com</h4>
            <p>I have been a chef for more than half my life, with experience in Southeast Asia and The Ritz London. My
                aim is to make great, classic, modern British food that’s seasonal and suitable for everyone. For me,
                the seasons are defined by food and it’s important to stay in touch with local suppliers and producers.
                I want to give all of our guests an extraordinary experience, including our vegan and vegetarian guests,
                by shining a light on plant-based cooking.</p>

                as the Head Concierge at one of the most prestigious Resort in puducherry, our motto being “No request

                this special city. My team and I are here at your disposal, and we look forward to booking you the most
                sought-after tickets and helping you to uncover puducherry's hidden gems.</p>
